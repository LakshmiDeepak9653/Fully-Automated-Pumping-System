# INTRODUCTION:
Aim is to develop a smart irrigation system to provide irrigation system which is automatic for the plants which help in saving water and money. Fields should neither be over-irrigated nor under-irrigated. The objective of this thesis is to design 
a simple, easy to install methodology to monitor and indicate the 
level of soil moisture that is continuously controlled in order 
to achieve maximum plant growth.

The Arduino UNO can be programmed to analyze some signals from sensors such as moisture, temperature, and rain. A pump is used to pump the fertilizer and water into the irrigation system. The use of easily available components reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs.

# What is an IOT ?
`Internet of Things`
> -  A network of physical objects that can interact with each other to share Information and take action.
> - The term was first proposed by Kevin Ashton in 1999.
> - The concept of IOT first become popular at the Auto-ID center, MIT.
> - IOT can be pronounced as Machine to Machine (M2M) technology.

# Abstract:-
The key objective of this project is to monitor the soilâ€™s moisture content during its dry and wet conditions with the aid of a moisture sensor circuit, calculate the corresponding relative humidity and irrigate it based on its nature using Arduino, Soil moisture sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, GSM and an automatic water inlet setup which can also monitor and record temperature, which is constantly modified and can be controlled in future to optimize these resources so that the plant growth and yield is maximized.
